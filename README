This is a start of "Tom's Wikipedia filter list".

It's a very simple list of images I don't want to see.

The inclusion criteria is completely personal: pictures I wouldn't wish to see
on Wikipedia if I had my screen in public view of others on a crowded commuter
train to London.

If you wish to make your own version, hey, it's on Github. Feel free to fork it
and make your own.

When I can be bothered, I'll make some tools for managing the list.

TODO:
* pull in stuff from Bad Images List
* pull in stuff from the usual categories on Commons
